# anangrybot

I use collected text from a channel on a Mumble server to train a Markov chain generator. My implementation isn't the best, but it is functional. I need more practice.

### todo

- [ ] bot needs to reconnect on disconnect (and so many retries)
- [ ] needs to be restructured and ability to accept a range for length of generated sentence
- [x] ~~maybe just write the generator in Go completely?~~
- [x] ~~better handling of missing key~~
